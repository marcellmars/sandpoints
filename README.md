# sandpoints
integration of gitea, hugo, pagedjs and memory of the world workflows into collaborative writing and publishing platform


the name? not necessary explanation but if we need one:
 
 
 > "A sandpoint is a groundwater source that is created by driving a small diameter screen into a shallow layer of sand that contains water. That screen is connected to a pipe that runs up through the ground and ultimately connects to a single stage jet pump. The pump is then plumbed into the home or irrigation system."

for now, this repo is a placeholder. the actual development is maintained at:
